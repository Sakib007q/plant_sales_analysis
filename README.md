<h2> Data Analysis & Visualization Project</h2>

****Project Overview**** 

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of a dataset related to user tracking data, visualized 
using Google Sheets. The objective is to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and present 
findings through various visual representations to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

****Data Source****: Client

****Tools****
* Google Sheets: Used for data cleaning, analysis, manipulation, and visualization to derive 
meaningful insights.

1. Customization and formatting of data sheets.
2. Data analysis and trend identification.
3. Interactive visualization of key insights from track_dataset.

****Key Insights & Findings****
* Identified customer usage patterns and behaviors across four countries.
* Assessed user engagement based on device preferences and interactions.
* Used graphs and charts to illustrate demographics, gender distribution, and visit time trends.

****Actionable Insights****
1. Device Usage Distribution: 
* Desktop accounts for 36% of traffic, slightly leading over mobile and tablet usage. 
* Desktop, mobile, and tablet usage remain closely distributed, emphasizing the need for cross
device optimization in marketing campaigns. 
2. Engagement Analysis: 
* Visit times fluctuate significantly, with some sessions exceeding 13 minutes, while others last less 
than a minute, indicating potential bounce rates or low engagement. 
* Identifying factors influencing session duration can help improve retention and user experience. 
* This analysis provides data-driven recommendations to enhance engagement strategies and 
optimize cross-platform user experiences.
